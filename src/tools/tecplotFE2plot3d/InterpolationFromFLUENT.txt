1. Once your FLUENT solution converges, "File - Export - Solution Data"

2. Choose "Tecplot" for "File Type"

3. "Surfaces" should be chosen; a typical choice is either "fluid" (if exists) or "default-interior"

4. Choose "Quantities": "Absolute Pressure, Density, Axial (or Streamwise) Velocity, Radial (or Transverse) Velocity"

5. A Tecplot binary file is generated and read it by Tecplot using a compatible version

6. Rearrange the solution variables so that their order is "Absolute Pressure, Density, Axial (or Streamwise) Velocity, Radial (or Transverse) Velocity" (the order matters)

7. Also check how many "Zones" there are within the Tecplot file

8. "File - Write Data File" and use "Tecplot ASCII Data Writer" to create a "*.dat" file; make sure to use "18" for "Precision", "Point" for "Format"; write only 

   x, y, absolute-pressure, density, axial-velocity, radial-velocity"
